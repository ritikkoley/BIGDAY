# HPC Backend Logic & Report Compilation System

## Overview

The Holistic Progress Card (HPC) backend system processes multi-stakeholder evaluations into comprehensive student reports following CBSE guidelines. This document outlines the complete processing pipeline from raw evaluations to published reports.

## ðŸ”„ Processing Pipeline

### Step 1: Evaluation Collection & Pre-Processing

**Input Sources:**
- **Teachers**: Subject-specific assessments, behavioral observations
- **Parents**: Home behavior, value demonstrations, family interactions
- **Peers**: Collaborative skills, social interactions, teamwork
- **Self-Assessment**: Student reflections, goal-setting, self-awareness
- **Counselors**: Emotional intelligence, social skills (optional)
- **Coaches**: Physical fitness, sports participation (optional)

**Pre-Processing Logic:**
```typescript
// Normalize scoring from 1-5 scale to CBSE grades
const normalizeScore = (score: number) => {
  if (score >= 4.5) return { grade: 'A+', level: 'outstanding' };
  if (score >= 3.5) return { grade: 'A', level: 'excellent' };
  if (score >= 2.5) return { grade: 'B', level: 'good' };
  if (score >= 1.5) return { grade: 'C', level: 'satisfactory' };
  return { grade: 'D', level: 'needs_improvement' };
};

// Validation rules
const validateEvaluation = (evaluation) => {
  - Score range: 1-5
  - Confidence level: 0-1
  - Qualitative remark: minimum 10 characters
  - Evidence attachment: optional but recommended
  - Evaluation deadline: within cycle period
};
```

### Step 2: Aggregation Rules

**Weightage Application:**
```typescript
// Parameter-level aggregation
const aggregateParameter = (evaluations, parameter, assignments) => {
  let weightedSum = 0;
  let totalWeight = 0;
  
  // Group by evaluator role
  assignments.forEach(assignment => {
    const roleEvaluations = evaluations.filter(e => e.role === assignment.role);
    if (roleEvaluations.length > 0) {
      const roleAverage = roleEvaluations.reduce((sum, eval) => sum + eval.score, 0) / roleEvaluations.length;
      weightedSum += roleAverage * assignment.weightage;
      totalWeight += assignment.weightage;
    }
  });
  
  return totalWeight > 0 ? weightedSum / totalWeight : 0;
};
```

**Example Weightage Distribution:**
- **Mathematics**: Teacher (70%), Parent (20%), Self (10%)
- **Creativity**: Teacher (60%), Peer (25%), Self (15%)
- **Teamwork**: Teacher (50%), Peer (30%), Parent (10%), Self (10%)
- **Empathy**: Teacher (40%), Parent (35%), Peer (25%)

**Remark Compilation:**
```typescript
const compileRemarks = (evaluations) => ({
  teacher_observations: evaluations
    .filter(e => e.role === 'teacher')
    .map(e => e.qualitative_remark),
  parent_feedback: evaluations
    .filter(e => e.role === 'parent')
    .map(e => e.qualitative_remark),
  peer_input: evaluations
    .filter(e => e.role === 'peer')
    .map(e => e.qualitative_remark),
  student_reflections: evaluations
    .filter(e => e.role === 'self')
    .map(e => e.qualitative_remark)
});
```

### Step 3: Approval Workflow

**Workflow Stages:**
1. **Draft** â†’ Compiled by system, awaiting review
2. **Under Review** â†’ Assigned to class teacher
3. **Approved** â†’ Approved by principal
4. **Published** â†’ Available to stakeholders

**Approval Logic:**
```typescript
const approvalWorkflow = {
  step1: {
    role: 'class_teacher',
    timeout: '3 days',
    actions: ['approve', 'reject', 'request_revision']
  },
  step2: {
    role: 'principal', 
    timeout: '7 days',
    actions: ['approve', 'reject', 'request_revision']
  },
  escalation: {
    auto_escalate: true,
    escalation_timeout: '2 days'
  }
};
```

**Version Control:**
- Each revision creates a new version
- Previous versions maintained for audit
- Approval resets for new versions
- Change tracking for all modifications
