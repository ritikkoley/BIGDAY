  ## Migration Execution Checklist

  ### Step 1: Infrastructure Preparation
  - [ ] Database backup completed and verified
  - [ ] Monitoring dashboards active and alerting
  - [ ] Migration team assembled and briefed
  - [ ] Rollback scripts prepared and tested
  - [ ] Communication sent to stakeholders

  ### Step 2: Schema Extension
  - [ ] Institutions table created or verified
  - [ ] Institution_id columns added to existing tables
  - [ ] All HPC tables created successfully
  - [ ] Constraints and indexes applied
  - [ ] No errors in application logs

  ### Step 3: Data Backfill
  - [ ] Backfill jobs started for all affected tables
  - [ ] Progress monitoring shows expected completion rates
  - [ ] No data integrity violations detected
  - [ ] Batch processing completing within time estimates
  - [ ] Error rates below acceptable thresholds (< 1%)

  ### Step 4: Constraint Addition
  - [ ] NOT NULL constraints added to institution_id columns
  - [ ] Foreign key constraints established
  - [ ] Composite indexes created successfully
  - [ ] RLS policies enabled and tested
  - [ ] Performance impact within acceptable range

  ### Step 5: Performance Optimization
  - [ ] Materialized views created and populated
  - [ ] Automatic refresh schedules configured
  - [ ] Query performance meets targets
  - [ ] Partition templates created for future scaling
  - [ ] Monitoring confirms improved query times

  ## Post-Migration Validation

  ### Data Integrity Validation
  - [ ] **Row Counts**: All expected rows migrated successfully
    ```sql
    -- Verify row counts match expectations
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_profiles WHERE institution_id IS NOT NULL;
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hpc_parameters WHERE active = true;
    ```

  - [ ] **Foreign Key Integrity**: All relationships valid
    ```sql
    -- Check for orphaned records
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_profiles u
    LEFT JOIN institutions i ON u.institution_id = i.id
    WHERE u.institution_id IS NOT NULL AND i.id IS NULL;
    ```

  - [ ] **Data Distribution**: Reasonable distribution across institutions
    ```sql
    -- Verify data distribution
    SELECT i.name, COUNT(u.id) as user_count
    FROM institutions i
    LEFT JOIN user_profiles u ON i.id = u.institution_id
    GROUP BY i.id, i.name;
    ```

  ### Performance Validation
  - [ ] **Query Performance**: Dashboard queries under target latency
  - [ ] **Index Usage**: Confirm indexes being used by query planner
  - [ ] **Materialized Views**: Views refreshing within time limits
  - [ ] **Concurrent Load**: System handles expected concurrent users

  ### Security Validation
  - [ ] **RLS Testing**: Role impersonation tests pass
  - [ ] **Cross-Tenant Isolation**: No unauthorized data access
  - [ ] **Audit Logging**: All HPC operations logged correctly
  - [ ] **Evidence Security**: File access properly restricted

  ### Functional Validation
  - [ ] **Demo Data**: Sample HPC data loads correctly
  - [ ] **API Endpoints**: All HPC APIs respond correctly
  - [ ] **UI Integration**: HPC tabs visible in all portals
  - [ ] **Workflow Testing**: Evaluation to report workflow functional

  ## Rollback Criteria

  ### Immediate Rollback Triggers
  - Application error rate > 5% above baseline
  - Database CPU usage > 90% for more than 10 minutes
  - Query latency > 3x baseline for critical operations
  - Data corruption detected in any table
  - Security breach or unauthorized access detected

  ### Rollback Execution Steps
  1. **Stop Migration**: Halt all migration processes immediately
  2. **Assess Impact**: Determine scope of rollback required
  3. **Execute Rollback**: Follow appropriate rollback procedure
  4. **Validate System**: Confirm system stability after rollback
  5. **Communicate Status**: Update stakeholders on rollback completion

  ## Success Metrics

  ### Technical Success Criteria
  - Zero application downtime during migration
  - All data integrity checks pass
  - Query performance within 10% of baseline
  - No security vulnerabilities introduced
  - All automated tests pass

  ### Business Success Criteria

  - Demo data allows full workflow testing
  - Export functionality produces valid PDFs
  - Multi-tenant data isolation confirmed
  - Stakeholder acceptance testing completed

  ## Final Approval

  ### Migration Readiness Confirmation
